15-112 Project -- La Prima

In my first semester at CMU, I took the introductory computer science course 15-112. I created a project called La Prima at the end of this course, applying the knowledge that I gained from this course. Using OOP fundamentals, the game La Prima mimics a game on the internet in which the user runs a coffee stand, purchasing ingredients and setting prices to gain the most amount of profit admist unpredictable weather conditions.
